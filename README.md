Using WASD or the arrow keys, you must navigate your character across the randomly generated map to the arrow randomly placed on the map. If you emerge victorious in your battles across the land, you will receive a small stat boost and some loot that will degrade after each turn. Apart from items that increase difficulty, your movement will determine the increase as well based on the color of the pixel you have moved to. During your journey, you will also encounter merchants that sell items that can be purchased multiple times if you have the gold. 

NOTE: Restarting makes the windows unresponsive until it has fully loaded.
